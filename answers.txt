SECTION 3: If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
ANSWER:
The program will return runtime error (cast error) that Object can't be cast as 
a media with the (Media)Object command.
Solution for this problem is to check whether the Object is an instance of Media 
or not before casting it to Media.
SECTION 6:
Create an ArrayList of Media, then add some media (CD, DVD, or Book) to the list. 
- Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using
the toString() method.
Observe what happens and explain it in detail:
ANSWER:
The toString() method will return the String that corresponding to the type of Media
The ArrayList of Media although gives the object with Media type, but its specific type of Media
overrided the toString() method -> Work properly
