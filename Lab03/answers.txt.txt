QUESTION 1: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to 
build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: No, Because title and category are both String type.

QUESTION 2: Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of 
arguments for dvd. Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
Answer: I prefer the one that allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments because i dont 
have to create a new array of dvds that i want to add.
